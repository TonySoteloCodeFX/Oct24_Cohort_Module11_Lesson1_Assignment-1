            <h2>Bio:</h2>
            <div>I am Vegeta, the Prince of all Saiyans. I was born on Planet Vegeta, the son of King Vegeta, and trained to be a fierce warrior from a young age. My childhood was filled with intense battles and the pursuit of strength. But everything changed when Frieza destroyed my home and wiped out my people. That event fueled my hatred for him and shaped the warrior I am today.</div>

            <div>I initially came to Earth as an enemy, determined to defeat Goku and prove I was the strongest. But over time, our rivalry turned into something more. I began to grow, not just as a fighter, but as a person. I formed bonds with my family—especially Bulma and Trunks—and they became my greatest motivation.</div>

            <div>My power grew exponentially, from achieving the Super Saiyan form to mastering even more advanced transformations. I eventually reached Super Saiyan Blue and the Destroyer form, training under Beerus, the God of Destruction, to push my limits even further. The Destroyer form combines the raw power of a god with the pride and fury of a Saiyan warrior.</div>

            <div>Through it all, I've never lost my determination to be the strongest, but I've also learned what it truly means to protect those I love. From the ruthless prince I once was to the warrior I am now, I've come a long way—but I'm far from done.
